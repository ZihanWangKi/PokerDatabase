What made good players good?

RiverVCom-Profit

Agressiveness within good, bad players

We tried to classify the Winning players and losing players.
Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, Support Vector Machine.
Below we elaborate on SVMs.

We devided the dataset into testing set(30%) and training set(70%). Within the training set, we did a 10 fold cross validation to tune the parameters for a Support Vector Classifer. Record the results:
Predictors, Score In train, Score In test, C, Gamma
('AvgB', 'AvgC', 'AvgK'), 0.73, 0.69, 8.25, 0.90
('AvgB', 'AvgC'), 0.73, 0.67, 4.25, 0.17
('AvgB', 'Aggressive'), 0.73, 0.64, 2.00, 0.30
('AvgB', 'AvgK', 'Aggressive'), 0.72, 0.69, 2.96, 0.91


*parameters tuned(For a Gaussain Kernal): C[0, 10], gamma[0.00001, 1], predictors to choose (At most 4 from AvgBet, AvgB, AvgR, AvgC, AvgK, Aggressive)
